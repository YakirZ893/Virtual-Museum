# Virtual Museum with VR Experience

Welcome to the Virtual Museum project! This repository hosts the source code and documentation for a virtual reality (VR) museum experience. In this project, we present an exhibition in the museum using microservices that retrieve information from a database.

## Project Overview

The Virtual Museum project aims to provide an immersive museum experience through virtual reality technology. Users can explore various exhibitions and artifacts within the museum environment using a VR headset. The project is built upon the concept of microservices architecture, where different services handle specific functionalities, such as fetching information about exhibits from a database.

## Folders

### 1) Microservice

The `microservice` folder contains the microservices responsible for retrieving information from the database and delivering it to the VR application. Each microservice is designed to handle a specific aspect of the museum's functionality, such as exhibit information, user preferences, authentication, etc.

### 2) Unity Project

The `Unity Project` folder hosts the Unity-based VR application that renders the museum environment and allows users to navigate through exhibitions. This project utilizes the Unity game engine to create immersive VR experiences. It interacts with the microservices to fetch exhibit data and provide a seamless museum exploration experience.

### 3) Project Documentation

The `project documentation` folder contains detailed documentation related to the Virtual Museum project. It includes:

- **Technical Documentation:** Comprehensive technical documentation describing the architecture, design, and implementation details of the project. This documentation provides insights into how the microservices interact with the database and the Unity application.
  
- **User Guide:** Instructions for users on how to set up and use the VR museum application. This includes guidance on installing the application, navigating through exhibitions, and interacting with museum artifacts.
  
- **API Documentation:** Documentation for the APIs exposed by the microservices. This includes details on endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication mechanisms.
  
- **Database Schema:** Description of the database schema used by the microservices to store exhibit information. This includes tables, relationships, and sample data.
